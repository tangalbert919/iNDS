iNDS
=======
###### iOS 8.1 or above required.

###### This version of iNDS contains code from other forks. This is simply an experiment to see if a bunch of developers from many places can truly benefit iNDS when the original developer is too busy to answer any questions.

iNDS is a derivation of the previous Nintendo DS apps for iOS, nds4ios and Nitrogen. Both are discontinued, or have been removed due to the DMCA takedown.

[Nitrogen](https://github.com/NitrogenEmulator) 

Currently, emulation is powered by the DeSmuME 0.9.10 threaded ARM interpreter and runs at full speed on 64-bit devices (for some games).

Any device that only has 256 MB of RAM will crash if a ROM is loaded. Such devices include the iPhone 3GS, iPad 1, iPod 4, and everything that precedes them.
