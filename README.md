# iNDS

This is iNDS, a Nintendo DS emulator built for the iOS platform, and based on two older (and discontinued) emulators: nds4ios and Nitrogen.

Because this is a fork from the [real iNDS project](https://github.com/WilliamLCobb/iNDS), expect some weird commits and experimental stuff on here.

iNDS uses [DeSmuME](http://desmume.org), a Nintendo DS emulator that was built for computers, but has been ported to mobile devices so people on the go can play their favorite DS games (none of which are included in this project or we would have copyright issues). The v1 branch in this fork utilizes DeSmuME 0.9.10, which is older but has been worked on recently. The master branch has DeSmuME 0.9.11, which is still in the works like the rest of iNDS, as we are preparing for a 2.0 release. Therefore, I advise everyone to stick to the official project or the v1 branch on this fork, because the master branch is not stable, and not user-friendly.

## Requirements:
* iOS 8.1 or above (iOS 9.0 if you are compiling from the master branch).
* Your device must be 64-bit (iPad Air, iPad Mini 2, iPhone 5S, iPod 6G, and everything newer than these).
* Your device must have 512 MB of RAM or more (which doesn't matter because that only affects some 32-bit devices).
* If you're compiling from source code, you need an Apple computer or a virtual hard disk and a program to run said hard disk. Please refer to this [wiki](https://github.com/WilliamLCobb/iNDS/wiki) for instructions on compiling the program.

## Issues:
These guidelines are to be followed, or I will close your issue without the need to say ANYTHING.

**Your issue will not be closed if it has these:**
* Your iOS device and version.
* Your version of iNDS that you have right now.
* Whether or not you're jailbroken (basically, do you have Cydia installed?).
* Where you got iNDS from.

**Your issue will be closed if it is about:**
* Support for 32-bit devices.
* Support for devices less than 256 MB of RAM.

**DISCLAIMER:** The Nintendo DS is a trademark of Nintendo, Inc. All games made by Nintendo or third parties that support the Nintendo DS belong to them, not us. We are not responsible for what you do to your device from running this program. Do not download iNDS from sources you don't know, because it is very easy to install a backdoor on this kind of software.
